# parallax example, mockup
Starting with an example, playing with parallax, aiming for a template for use in WordPress.

The panels*.* set of files encompass the mockup for the TouchJet front page and will be encorporated into a WordPress plugin.
It became less of a parallax example and more of a foreground sprite moving thru a set of billboards, which changed as the
sprite moved over them. Technically, it is "parallax" in the sense that you have images scrolling at different speeds (and 
even different directions), but I don't think this is what people are looking for when they think "parallax". 

As repo's go, it's a bit jumbled, but I needed to move btwn multiple staging environ's so that's what I did. 

Moving to DCS-Billboard-Page plugin.
